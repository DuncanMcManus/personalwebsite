          I'm Duncan McManus, a junior studying Computer Science at Brown University.  I'm interested in software development across the stack and am particularly
          passionate about projects involving Virtual Reality or Robotics.  Outside of CS, I've enjoyed taking classes in Environmental Science and Comparative Literature.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love creating apps from scratch with friends so I've attended three hackathons.  These projects, as well as some from class, are detailed
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also have experience working with large existing code bases.  I spent this past summer interning at GE Digital, developing software as part of an AGILE team.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I return to Brown in the fall, I will continue to do research work as part of the Humans to Robots Laboratory.  My most recent work there was to 
          create a Virtual Reality display of a robot's current position and orientation that updates live as the robot moves.  This was done using JavaScript, 
          A-Frame, and data from a ROS Topic subscription.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of school, I've done improv comedy for many years.  I enjoy hikes, travel, and playing video games with friends.  I'm a big fan of a lot of music and even 
          <a href="https://www.facebook.com/DuncanAndTheSevenBraids/">have a band named after me</a> (that I'm not in).

        <h2>Rhode to Vote</h2>
        <p>
            Rhode to Vote is a ride-sharing platform for voting access. People who can't get to the polls are able to sign up and request a ride. Volunteers sign up and are given a route to pick up voters based on available time, distance, and preferences. On this 4 person multi-month project, I worked on the Java backend. I wrote three different modified Dijkstra and Breadth First Search graph traversal algorithms to find optimal routes.

          <p>
              Google Maps clone made from scratch. Web app displays a street map that can be panned, zoomed, and clicked for point-route selection. I wrote the Java backend which implements a KD-Tree to store location data, A* for finding shortest paths, Proxy Pattern for caching on database requests, and a Trie for autocorrecting street names. I also wrote a JavaScript front-end which uses tile caching for displaying map sections.

          <h2>Attic</h2>
          <p>
              Attic gives users ownership of a Virtual Reality space which they can create, design, and share with others. For Hack@Brown 2018 I led my team in creating a mobile AR web app that lets the user select a 3D model from a menu and place it in their surrounding space.  This is an ongoing project with a POC written in JavaScript using Google's three.ar.js, it is being transitioned to Unity.

            <h2>Soundstage</h2>
            <p>
                Created for Hack@Brown 2017. Soundstage is for music fans that have trouble keeping up with all their favorite artists. After an artist name is entered, it presents a chronological feed of releases. I was the team leader and wrote JavaScript to get user input, make a request to the Spotify API, and parse results.
